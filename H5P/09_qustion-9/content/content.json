With a little knowledge, you can protect yourself from being a victim.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this module, we will learn about your rights and responsibilities as a consumer. We will explore the different parts of a contract, and what you need to know before you sign on the dotted line.

You'll be prepared to protect yourself against unscrupulous people and organizations.<\/p>\n\n<p>You, as a consumer, have the ultimate power in our free enterprise system. The government and the market provide a variety of consumer protections and laws to ensure that our consumer transactions are safe and legal.
